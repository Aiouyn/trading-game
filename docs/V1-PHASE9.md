# V1 Phase 9: status

This file records each Phase 9 track's status. Track 9A (acceptance matrix) is recorded here first. The matrix is
`docs/V1-ACCEPTANCE.md`; its counts and per-row commands are the source of truth for the acceptance state.

## 9A acceptance matrix

**Counts** (regenerated from the tape spec tables and the Vitest title index): see the header of `docs/V1-ACCEPTANCE.md`.

**Status vocabulary.** PASS, PARTIAL (part of the row passes; the named remainder is not met or not written), FAIL,
NOT RUN, NOT BUILT, DEFERRED (ruling named), N/A (reason given).

**Rules applied in this pass (after the reviewer's findings on 02139aa):**
- A PASS needs an executable `it()` or `test()`. A `describe` whose block holds only `it.todo` or `it.skip` does not
  back a row. The matrix generator now refuses such describes.
- A row whose spec gate is larger than the written test is PARTIAL, not PASS, and names the unwritten part.
- A row whose spec claim is not what the code does is PARTIAL until the spec wording or the test is corrected, and the
  deviation is written here.

**Reasoned deviations and rulings recorded in this pass:**
- `M02 unit`: the spec says `shockPrice` changes only `assets[id].lnP`. The code also sets the day's Test-shock field
  `dayShock` on that asset (`src/engine/sim.ts`, `shockPrice`), so the close prints and labels the move. The design is
  deliberate (the comment at that line says so). The row is PARTIAL until the test asserts `dayShock`.
- `desk_rank_loss_keeps_files`: N/A by lead ruling D-13 (rank never drops, so no rank-loss lock exists).
- `event_invalid_values`: the spec gate is 200 seeds x 5 game years with the flash ±15% halt checked. The written test is
  20 seeds x 1 year and checks NaN, Infinity and the floor. `worldEvents.ts` has no ±15% halt clause. PARTIAL.
- `wm_slot_exact`: at 1440 x 900 the Broker fits 4 of 12 slots (L2, R2, L23, R23). The other 8 are refused as too small.
  The spec says every slot at that size. PARTIAL. The 1920 x 1080 half is covered in the same test.
- `cap_carry_edge`, `signal_postprint_drift`: the bots and probes are `it.todo` in
  `src/world/company/exploits/blocked.test.ts` (blocked: the bot harness and the engine probe are not in the worktree,
  and the binding gate is engine-staging). NOT BUILT. N17 and X10 (company) take the worst of their gates.
- Describe-title citations: a PASS row may name a `describe` title when that describe holds executable `it()` tests
  (checked by the generator). Rows that name only a todo or skip describe are not PASS.
